## 🎯 About

Lancebot is not a gimmick. It's a utility tool built around real needs, powered by:
- **47,382 taste memories** from South Africans
- **Lancewood's complete recipe library**
- **Real product recommendations**
- **Contextual understanding** of South African cooking culture

### The Big Idea

AI can generate recipes. **Taste is human.** So we asked South Africans to teach Lancebot what cheese should smell like, taste like, and feel like. The result is an AI that responds like a human would - because it learned from humans.
